# Notes

### Rubber

_In General_:
* Thicker rubber provides more power but also runs out quicker
* Thinner rubber gives a slower prop rpm but lasts longer (inflight)

_For 2019_:
* There was no limit on rubber mass this year, so there was a lot of flexibility
* FFM reccomended starting with medium width .094 rubber (3/32)
* On scioly.org it said that optimal loop length was 1.5x motorstick length

### Props
* Ikara props tend to be the best since they're very light
* Change the pitch by bending the hub
* Coarse (wide) pitch goes well with thicker rubber
